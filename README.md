# Traces

This repository generates the images that are used in the paper "How Many Equations of Motion Describe a Moving Human?". Preprint here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14331

The objective of that paper is to provide some empirical constraints on the set of differential equations that describe the motion of a moving human.

The code relies on the Crawdad dataset on MobilityModels: https://crawdad.org/ncsu/mobilitymodels/20090723

Simply copy the traceset downloaded from the previous link into the folder: ".\Traces_TimeXY_30sec_txt\", and then run all cells in the notebook.
