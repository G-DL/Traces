This repository generates the images that are used in the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14331)[How Many Equations of Motion Describe a Moving Human?].

The objective of that paper is to provide some empirical constraints on the set of differential equations that describe the motion of a moving human.

The code relies on the (Crawdad dataset on MobilityModels)[https://crawdad.org/ncsu/mobilitymodels/20090723]
